                <div class="accommodation-option">
                    <h3>On-site at Ashokan Center</h3>
                    <p> As we party late into Saturday night, we want you to be able to stagger into bed as late as you wish. There are enough beds for the entire wedding party.</p>
                                            
                    <p>Beds at Ashokan are humble. While the mattresses are thick and comfortable, it's like upscale summer camp. Most beds are bunks.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you'd like to stay on-site, please indicate this in your RSVP form and we'll be in touch with more details.</p>

                    <h3>Room options</h3>

                    <p> Ashokan offers four types of rooms. Please note that due to capacity of the rooms below, unless your wedding party has 3, 4, or 5 people (including children), you will likely need to share a room with fellow guests. Don't worry, we'll help you to find a great match! We encourage you to establish room blocks with mutual friends yourselves. Otherwise, we'll assist you in finding comfortable room assignments with fellow guests. </p>

                    <p>All arrangements cost $55-$75 per person per night. <br />
