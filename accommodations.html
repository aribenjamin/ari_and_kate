                <div class="accommodation-option">
                    <h3>On-site at Ashokan Center</h3>
                    <p>We recommend you stay with us at the Ashokan Center. As we party into the wee hours on Saturday night, we want you to be able to stagger into bed at any late time of your choosing. There are enough beds for the entire wedding party.</p>
                                            
                    <p>Beds at Ashokan are humble. While the mattresses are thick and comfortable, it's like upscale summer camp. Most beds are bunks. </p>

                    <h4>Private Rooms</h4>
                    <p>There are 20 private rooms at Ashokan. Eight of these have queen bunks (queen on the bottom, twin on top). The other 12 rooms have two twin bunk beds. All rooms have their own bathroom.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Ashokan dorms</h4>
                    <p>Ashokan has 3 large dormitory rooms that have 12 bunk beds each. Combined, these rooms can sleep 72 people. We know you've developed higher standards of privacy since the days of summer camp. BUT how much time will you spend in your room anyways?</p>
                    
                    <p>If you'd like to stay on-site, please indicate this in your RSVP form and we'll be in touch with more details.</p>

                    <p>We recognize that some guests will want more privacy and comfort than Ashokan has to offer. 
                    For those not staying up especially late on Saturday, there are a range of luxury accommodations that can be found within a 30-minute drive of the venue.</p>
